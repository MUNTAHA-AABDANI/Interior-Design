          <b>Interior design</b>  is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier
             and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. An interior designer is
             someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement projects. Interior design
             is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site
             inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project,
             construction management, and execution of the design.

       <b>Good decorators</b>  are skilled at coming into a room and whipping it into visual shape. For new spaces, they can 
          help clients decide on a style, choose a color scheme, purchase furniture, and accessorize. They're also
          often brought in to spruce up an existing space that needs to be updated or redone.
    </p>
    <p id="p3">
        Decorators don't generally work with any contractors or architects, since structural work is usually 
        complete before they come on board. They do, however, work with furniture makers, upholsterers, and 
        other industry professionals. Most often, though, they work directly with homeowners or business managers.
